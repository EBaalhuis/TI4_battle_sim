# TI4 odds calculator
This project provides a combat calculator for Twilight Imperium (4th edition) produced by Fantasy Flight Games. The live version is hosted at [ti4odds.herokuapp.com](https://ti4odds.herokuapp.com)

The calculator works by simulating combat, using a random number generator to simulate dice rolls. This means you might get slightly different results when you calculate the same scenario several times. Results are accurate to a few percentage points. If you find any bugs or problems, please let me know by opening an issue.
